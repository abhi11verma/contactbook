## Learning React - Hardway
We will be building a complex CRUD Singlepage application - "Contact Book"

Front End : React<br>
Back End : php

###Creating the project

We will need a toolchain to initialize the react project, React Team recommends multiple options, here we will stick to a basic [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npx create-react-app contactbook`

This will create a project named `contactbook` with a basic react page.

### Start the App

Run the following command in the contactbook root folder
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
